# Advanced Machine Learning Task 1
You are required to use Machine Learning to tackle the problem of **“Image-Text Matching”**. Given an image and a textual description, the task is to predict whether they match or not. This implies a binary classification task, where there is a match when the image and text correspond to each other—no match otherwise, see examples in the table below. The data for this task will be generated by the delivery team from the Flickr8k or Flicker30k datasets. This data was originally proposed by (Hodosh et al, 2013, JAIR) and (Young et al, 2014, TACL) to investigate methods at the intersection between machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.

| Image | Text | Label |
| ----- | ---- | ----- |
| ![Image Description](image_url) | A young child is walking on a stone-paved street with a metal pole and a man behind him. | match |
| ![Image Description](image_url) | A little boy skateboarder is doing a trick on his board while another young skateboarder watches. | no-match |
| ![Image Description](image_url) | Two workers at a grocery store observing something out of camera range. | match |
| ![Image Description](image_url) | A man is riding a tiny motorcycle through a busy market. | no-match |

Your task involves training and evaluating at least three machine-learning classifiers for matching images and sentences. To do that, you will use a unique dataset (different and potentially smaller than the originally proposed due to computing requirements) available via Blackboard. Since the dataset will contain different data splits (training, validation, and test examples), you are reminded that the test data should not be involved during training. It should only be used for testing your trained classifiers, and it should be used only to report the performance of the predictions of your proposed models.

You are expected to explore a range of machine learning classifiers inspired by the materials presented and discussed within the module and beyond (i.e., from reading related literature). You will investigate compare and critique their performance to justify your recommendations. Your comparisons should include metrics such as Balanced Classification Accuracy, precision-recall, F-measure, and any other metrics that you consider relevant. In this assignment, you are free to train any classifier, do any pre-and/or post-processing of the data, and implement your algorithm(s) whenever possible instead of only using libraries. You are allowed to use publicly available libraries to train your models; for example, you can use any deep learning frameworks and tools (e.g. Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch, ChatGPT). However, you will need to clearly mention your resources, acknowledge them appropriately, and compare between classifiers and their results in your report.
