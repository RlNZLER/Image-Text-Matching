# Advanced Machine Learning
# Task 1
You are required to use Machine Learning to tackle the problem of **“Image-Text Matching”**. Given an image and a textual description, the task is to predict whether they match or not. This implies a binary classification task, where there is a match when the image and text correspond to each other—no match otherwise, see examples in the table below. The data for this task will be generated by the delivery team from the Flickr8k or Flicker30k datasets. This data was originally proposed by (Hodosh et al, 2013, JAIR) and (Young et al, 2014, TACL) to investigate methods at the intersection between machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.

Your task involves training and evaluating at least three machine-learning classifiers for matching images and sentences. To do that, you will use a unique dataset (different and potentially smaller than the originally proposed due to computing requirements) available via Blackboard. Since the dataset will contain different data splits (training, validation, and test examples), you are reminded that the test data should not be involved during training. It should only be used for testing your trained classifiers, and it should be used only to report the performance of the predictions of your proposed models.

You are expected to explore a range of machine learning classifiers inspired by the materials presented and discussed within the module and beyond (i.e., from reading related literature). You will investigate compare and critique their performance to justify your recommendations. Your comparisons should include metrics such as Balanced Classification Accuracy, precision-recall, F-measure, and any other metrics that you consider relevant. In this assignment, you are free to train any classifier, do any pre-and/or post-processing of the data, and implement your algorithm(s) whenever possible instead of only using libraries. You are allowed to use publicly available libraries to train your models; for example, you can use any deep learning frameworks and tools (e.g. Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch, ChatGPT). However, you will need to clearly mention your resources, acknowledge them appropriately, and compare between classifiers and their results in your report.

## Image-Text Matching Classifier: Assignment Task 1

### Overview

To tackle Task 1 of your assignment, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Obtain the dataset provided by the delivery team, containing image-text pairs with corresponding labels.
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Feature Extraction/Engineering**:
   - Extract features from both images and text. For images, this might involve using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like VGG, ResNet, or Inception to extract image features. For text, techniques like word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) or transformer models (e.g., BERT) can be used.
   - Engineer additional features if necessary, such as image and text length, or any domain-specific features.

3. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Choose at least three machine learning classifiers to train on the extracted features. Some options include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), or Neural Networks.
   - Train the chosen classifiers on the training set using the extracted features.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained classifiers on the validation set using metrics such as Balanced Classification Accuracy, Precision-Recall, F-measure, etc.
   - Tune hyperparameters if necessary based on validation performance.

5. **Comparison and Critique**:
   - Compare the performance of the trained classifiers on the validation set.
   - Critique the strengths and weaknesses of each classifier, considering factors such as interpretability, computational complexity, and generalization ability.

6. **Testing**:
   - Select the best-performing classifier based on validation performance.
   - Evaluate this classifier on the test set and report its performance using the agreed-upon metrics.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Clearly document the entire process in a report, including data preprocessing steps, feature extraction methods, model architectures, training procedures, evaluation metrics, results, comparisons, and critiques.
   - Mention any publicly available libraries or tools used for training the models.
   - Acknowledge appropriate sources and references.
